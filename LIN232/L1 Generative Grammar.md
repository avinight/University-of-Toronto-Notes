- The customers hated that the rutabaga cheesecake tasted like meat cookies.
- What did the customers hate that the rutabaga cheesecake tasted like?
vs.
- The customers hated the rutabaga cheesecake more than they hated meat cookies.
- *What did the customers hate the rutabaga cheesecake more than they hated?

"Your experience underdetermines your knowledge." -> You know more than you experience

## Non-errors in child language

  - Swap the first two words around.
  - Swap the first verb with the first noun phrase.
  - Swap the subject and the verbal element after it.

e.g. "The woman who is singing is happy."
  - *Woman the who is singing is happy?
  - *Is the woman who singing is happy?
  - Is the woman who is singing happy?
    
  Children don't even bother with the simpler rule. Language syntax rules don't do those things.
  The correct rule is structure dependent: (we'll draw trees)

  negation in English is not positive? -> cultural semantics

  Green furious ideas colorlessly sleep -> metaphor or no? Why can't I abstract this to compare similarities.

## Chapter 2 Carnie
- Syntactic category or word class: the word's part of speech

How then can you know the part of speech of a word without knowing it's meaning?
- The various parts of speech are not semantically defined. They depend on:
  1. where the words appear in the sentence
  2. what affixes they take

#### Morphological distribution: refers to the kinds of affixes and other morphology that appear on a word.
Types of morphemes:
  1. derivational: affixes that make words out of other words
  2. inflectional: don't make a word into a particular category, but instead only _attach_ to certain categories.

#### Syntactic distribution: refers to what other words appear near the word.
##### Nouns
  1. nouns typically appear after determiners; they need not to be nouns.
  2. nouns can follow prepositions
  3. nouns can appear as the subject of the sentence
  4. nouns can appear as the direct object
  5. negated with _no_

**_Substitution test for nouns_**: can we substitute another noun for the word to see if its clearly a noun?

##### Verbs
  1. verbs can follow auxiliaries and modals (eg. will, have, having), and the non-finite marker _to_.
  2. verbs follow subjects, and can follow adverbs such as _often_ and _frequently_.
  3. negated with _not_

##### Adjectives
  1. adjectives can appear between determiners and nouns.
  2. adjectives can follow the auxiliary (_am/is/are/was/were/be/been/being_) (distribution overlaps with verbs.)
  3. Modifiable with _very_ (distribution overlaps with adverbs)

##### Adverbs
  1. adverbs can't appear between a determiner and a noun (*_the quickly fox_)
  2. can't appear after the verb _is_ and its variants
  3. can be modified by the adverb _very_

(**_Circularity_**: Have we created a circular argument: category determines position in the sentence and the position in the sentence determines category?)

**_Complementary distribution_**: where you get an adjective vs. an adverb is entirely predictable. adjectives appear inside NPs, while adverbs appear elsewhere.

*Neologisms*: new words

*open class*: parts of speech that allow new members (closed class is the opposite)

*lexical* parts of speech provide content of the sentence
*Functional* parts of speech provide the grammatical info

count vs. mass noun distinction is closely related to the plural vs singular.

Mass nouns take quantifier _must_
count nouns take quantifier _many_

mass nouns don't require a determiner, count nouns do

Possessive pronouns behave like pronouns -> binding
they also behave like determiners: Complementary distribution with determiners as they appear at the beginning of a noun phrase.

Anaphors (nouns like himself, herself) are pronouns too.
  - A special kind of pronoun that refers back to another noun in the sentence

*Valency*: argument structure; the number of arguments a particular predicate requires.

## Categories
- **Distinguishing environment**: A position in which only members of one class may grammatically appear.
- **Distribution**: Words have the same distribution if they can appear in the same <u>environment</u>

## L1 Recap
Why is adverb the worst possible name?
Not all things that modify verbs are adverbs
- PPs modify
- NPs modify
(e.g.) Tong arrived <= Intransitive

__Copula Test__
introduce predicates/adjectives/prepositions not adverbs

PQuals are to prepositions, as Adjectives are to Nouns

Why can't prepositions be ambi-transitive?
Some prepositions are obligatorily transitive

obligatorily - in a manner that cannot be evaded
